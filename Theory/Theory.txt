Three Types of DB
    Structured: Data with high degree of organisation, such that inclusion in a relational DB is seamless and readily searchable by Simple, straightforward Search Engine algo.
    Semi-Structured: Data that does not reside in a DB but has some organised data to make process easily.
    Unstructured: Does not have a pre-defined data model or is not organised in a pre-defined manner. It is generally text-heavy. 
        For eg: E-Mail messages, Word processing Documents, Videos, photos etc.

    Dynamo DB Table:
    It contains Item
        {Consider as Java Objects}
        In dynamo DB, there is one unique primary key.
        Dynamo DB contains data in form of table.

    ITEMS
    Group of attribute that is uniquely identifiable among all of the other items.

    ATTRIBUTES
    Each ITEM is composed of One or More attribute.
    An attribute consist of  the attribute name and a value or a set of values
    NOTE: It can have data upto 400kb, for data more than this, S3 bucket is used.
    The data is in S3 bucket and the URL is stored in the attribute.

    DDB allows low latency read/write access to items.
    Can be used to store pointers to S3 stoed Objects, or items to size larger thna 400kb of size.
    DDb stores the data indexed by Primary Key.
    User specifies the primary key while creating the table.
    DDB tables are schemaless, i.e. the datatype doesn't need to be defined beforehand, the datatype can be unique.
    i.e. key value pair format. The key/data can be integer string etc.
